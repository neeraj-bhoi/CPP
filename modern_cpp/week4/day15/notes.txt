time complexity is not measured in units of time,
it is always concerned about "how many operations
Time complexity analysis{
    - always find relation between N (number of input items) and operation where "operation"
        is context specific
        eg. in linear search -> operation is "access element and compare"
            int binary search -> check middle -> if found "okay", else "divide
}


//linear search
    - O(N)
    - operation : Access itams and compare
