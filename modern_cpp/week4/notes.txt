while working on a map each entry is a pair of key and values

the pair which you fetch is an rvalue, since it is returned from somewhere.

which is why we need to use const lvalue reference.

and copy constructure of pair is disabled, so & is neccessary

we can only use a pair in paramenter using const lvalue reference.
